Usage:
  orthomclAdjustFasta taxon_code fasta_file id_field
  
where:
  taxon_code:  a three or four letter unique abbreviation for the taxon
  fasta_file:  the input fasta file
  id_field:    a number indicating what field in the definition line contains
               the protein ID.  Fields are separated by either ' ' or '|'. Any
               spaces immediately following the '>' are ignored.  The first
               field is 1. For example, in the following definition line, the
               ID (AP_000668.1) is in field 4:  >gi|89106888|ref|AP_000668.1|

Input file requirements:
  (1) .fasta format
  (2) a unique id is provided for each sequence, and is in the field specified
      by id_field

Output file format:
  (1) .fasta format
  (2) definition line is of the form:
         >taxoncode|unique_protein_id

The output file is named taxoncode.fasta
